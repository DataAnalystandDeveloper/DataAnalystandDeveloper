### üìä Projects:
- [Project 1 File Organizer](https://github.com/DataAnalystandDeveloper/File-Sorter)
  - This Python script organizes files within a specified directory by moving them into categorized folders based on file type. It's especially useful for tidying up directories with mixed file types, such as .xlsx, .pdf, .ppt, and .csv files. Automatically categorizes files into predefined folders: Excel Files, Ppt Files, Pdf Files, and Csv Files. Checks if folders already exist before creating them. Handles both uppercase and lowercase file extensions (e.g., .PDF, .xlsx). Prints a message for files that don't match any specified extensions.

- [Project 2 BMI Calculator](https://github.com/DataAnalystandDeveloper/BMI-Calculator)
  - This is a simple BMI (Body Mass Index) calculator written in Python. The program takes the user's weight (in pounds) and height (in inches) as input and calculates their BMI. It then categorizes the BMI based on standard weight classifications.
How It Works
The program calculates BMI using the formula:
[ BMI = \frac{{weight \times 703}}{{height^2}} ]
Based on the calculated BMI, it provides feedback on the user's weight category, such as underweight, normal weight, overweight, or obese.
