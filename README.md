### 📊 Projects:
- [Project 1 File Organizer](https://github.com/DataAnalystandDeveloper/File-Sorter)
  - This Python script organizes files within a specified directory by moving them into categorized folders based on file type. It's especially useful for tidying up directories with mixed file types, such as .xlsx, .pdf, .ppt, and .csv files. Automatically categorizes files into predefined folders: Excel Files, Ppt Files, Pdf Files, and Csv Files. Checks if folders already exist before creating them. Handles both uppercase and lowercase file extensions (e.g., .PDF, .xlsx). Prints a message for files that don't match any specified extensions.

### 🏅 Education:
